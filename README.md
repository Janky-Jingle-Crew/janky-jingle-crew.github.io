## About
We are the Janky Jingle Crew, a group of makers who come together every year to make cool Christmas cards, which we give out to family and friends. This originally started when we were part of the [CASE association](https://caselabbet.se) at Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, Sweden, and it has since become a tradition.
